OS Ticket PDF Parser - Documentation

OVERVIEW:
This tool processes ZIP archives containing osTicket exported PDFs. It performs 
in-memory parsing to convert unstructured PDF text into structured JSONL data 
suitable for Postgres/Database ingestion.

CAPABILITIES:
1. Regex Metadata: Extracts Ticket #, Status, Dept, and Customer info from page 1.
2. Thread Splitting: Uses "Anchor Patterns" (Date + Name) to identify where one 
   message ends and another begins.
3. Logical Threading: Identifies if a block is a Message, Internal Note, or 
   Status Event (Resolved/Closed).
4. Time Analytics: Calculates 'raised_at', 'resolved_at', and detects re-opened 
   activity (messages appearing after a resolution event).

CONFIGURATION:
- If date formats change in the PDF, update THREAD_ANCHOR_PATTERN.
- If osTicket labels change (e.g., "Assigned To" instead of "Dept"), 
  update METADATA_PATTERNS.

OUTPUTS:
- tickets.jsonl: The main data file.
- errors.csv: Log of any corrupted PDFs or Zips that failed to parse.
